    <h3>Diary Studies</h3>
    <h5> Participants </h5>
    <p> We recruited 10 participants - 8 college students, a working professional and a high school study to study their breakfast habits for 4 days.</p>
    <h5> Design</h5>
    <p> Participants were instructed to fill out a <a href="http://bit.ly/2CgDA9i">form</a> and send a picture of their breakfast (if any) over the next 4 days. The form asked questions about their sleeping times, breakfast and acitivties in the morning.  </p>

    <h5> Key Insights from diary study</h5>

    <ul> 
        <li>Most people ate breakfast, but more often than not these meals were not healthy or of a sufficient amount </li>
        <li>Meals tended to be on the go or very quick as the participants had to rush to classes or jobs </li>
        <li> People often ate whatever was in the cupboard, in the fridge, or lying on the counter - healthy or not</li>
        <li>People tended to spend more time eating or eating a larger amount if they ate with others </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We chose the  participants highlighted in green for post-study interviews because they could be categorized by their their relatively high motivation and unhealthy behavior. This lets us design for one problem: behavior (and not motivation). </p>

    <h6> B - Engineer at tech company in bay area</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>
            B's morning routine was the most interesting where she:
            woke up and pooped for 20 minutes -> had coffee and breakfast -> pooped again for 20 mintues  </li>
            <p>
                <i class="i-b">“Coffee and whatever I eat with coffee are considered breakfast (need to drink coffee to poop)”</i>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            <i class="i-b">“I don’t eat out for breakfast because of my poop schedule”</i>

        </p>

    </ul>
    <h6> D - Highschool student in bay area</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>
        D didn't spend much time on breakfast, whether she was rushing late for school or wanted something easy to prepare on a weekend  </li>



        <p>
            <i class="i-b">“When she [sister] is home, she usually makes me eat something healthy like carrots. I don’t know how she does it. Just by putting it out”</i>

        </p>

        <p>
            <i class="i-b">“If I have a swim meet in the morning, I usually eat healthier because I don’t want to upset my stomach or anything and I feel like it is better for my body.”</i>

        </p>

    </ul>
    <h6> I - Graduate student living in London</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>
        I usually grabbed a snack like a juice or a doughnut during the days she had classes but would have proper breakfast when at her brother's home </li>
        <p>
            <i class="i-b">“I’m always late for class or i prefer sleeping than getting up early to make breakfast”</i>

<h3> Interview Insights -> Design Choices </h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Wanting to have energy for their daily routines was a component of what and when people ate  -> people need a way to conveniently get energy through food in the morning </li>

    <li>People don’t often think about what they will eat the night before, and leave those thoughts to the busy morning -> designing a system where people don’t have to think about food, instead having it just presented to them is critical </li>

    <li>Morning routines are very rushed and leave no time for behavior changes like making time to make breakfast themselves -> focusing on convenience and ease of access of the food is important</li>
</ul>

<h5> Key Factors for Design of solution</h5>
<h6> Time:</h6> <p> Sleep time, wake up time, breakfast prep time, first thing on schedule</p>
<h6> Food availibility:</h6> <p> Whats avaiable at home, whats home on the way/at school/work</p>
<h6> People</h6>  <p> If someone else is cooking, friends are over or going out </p>


<h3> Solution </h3>
<p> After brainstorming several ideas and considering the above factors we decided to go with a delivery service which would ensure that food is available and no time is spent for the user in its preperation</p>
<h5> Design Choices</h5>

<h6>Delivery vs Pickup</h6>
<p>Delivery- with the delivery service, the time a user needs to spend on getting the breakfast is shortened</p>
<h6>Raw Materials vs Ready-to-eat</h6>
<p>Ready-to-eat- ready-to-eat food cuts the meal preparation time</p>
<h6>Subscription  vs Order on the Go</h6>
<p>Subscription: user doesn’t need to take time out of their busy routine to order everyday</p>
<h6>Weekly vs Daily</h6>
<p>Daily: daily delivery guarantees that the food is fresh and since its outside their door everyday it serves as a reminder to eat the breakfast</p>
<h6>Standardized Menu vs Personalized Menu</h6>
<p>Standardized menu: people also spend a lot of time and energy in deciding what they will have, it was also convenient for our prototype to keep the menu standardized </p>

<h5> Final Solution</h5>
<img class="text-center img-fluid" src='images/behavior-change/breakfastdelivery.png'>
<p> A breakfast subscription service that delivers ready-to-eat breakfast  everyday to a specific location at a particular time based on the user’s request.

    Because convenience/time availability is the #1 reason why our diary study participants are not able to eat healthy breakfast everyday,
    healthy food is delivered to the user’s location and is delivered every morning to help form a habit

        <p class="caption"> wireflow</p>
    </div>
</p>
<h5> Key steps</h5>
<ul> 

    <li> <b>Sign up</b> A user signs up for the service by choosing a plan, specifying food restrictions and when and where he/she wants the food to be delivered</li>
    <li><b> Get notificaiions </b> A user will get notified on menus and delivery status</li>
    <li> <b>Get food </b> A user will receive ready-to-eat food every morning</li>
    <li> <b> Provide feedback</b> A user can provide feedback on the food and the service</li>
</ul>
<h3> Prototype and field study </h3>

<p>We decided to run a field study with a prototype breakfast delivery service. We recruited 5 graduate students who were willing to pay 10$ for 4 days of breakfast delivery. After each day they would fill out a survey asking if they ate the meal and how it fit in their morning routine  </p>

<ul>
    <li> 2 particpipants had < 2 breakfasts last week </li>
    <li> 2 particpants had 3-5 breakfasts that werent healthy </li>
</ul>

    </div>

    <p class="mx-auto"> participant's breakfast</p>


</div>
<h5> Results </h5>

<ul> 
    <li> Participants consumed 14/16 of the breakfasts we provided them</li>
    <li>2 particpants went from having 1-2 breakfasts to having breakfast on all 4 days </li>
    <li> 2 participants went from having insufficient/unhealthy breakfast to our alternative</li>


</ul>

<h5> Post study interviews and keytakeaways</h5>
<ul> 

    <li><b>Sleeping & Breakfast </b>There is a strong connection between sleep and breakfast and we inadvertently also changed some of our participants’ sleeping behaviors where some slept longer because they no longer needed to prepare breakfast and some woke up earlier because they were looking forward to having their breakfast. </li>

    <li> <b> Breakfast & Energy</b>Having the breakfast provides our participants with energy to work during the day. They also get a smaller lunch or get lunch later after having the breakfast because of the energy they get from it</li>

    <li> <b> Deciding the meal </b>It takes brain power and time to decide what to eat, which is why people didn’t mind having a lot of say in what they were having for breakfast.</li>

    <li><b> Broadening the options for breakfast </b>People didn’t consider alternative breakfast options like yogurt, cereal and boiled eggs until they go through the experiment; we changed their perspective on what is possible for breakfast. </li>
</ul>
