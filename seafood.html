<h3> Problem & Requirements </h3>
<p> A requirement document from the Moneterey Bay Aquarium told us that they wanted us to simplify the app experience since existing users found it difficult to navigate because the information hierarchy causes various misunderstandings and confusion</p>


<h3> Usability Studies </h3>
<p>To understand the problems the users were facing  we conducted usability studies with the  Seafood Watch Application and two other apps in the same domain. This helped us understand what works and what doesn't. We tested 6 users, all of them Stanford students  </p>


<h5> Key insights about Seafood Watch app by the Monterey Bay Aquarium </h5>
<ul>
    <li> Users were constantly overwhelmed by the number of options provided at each screen and the ‘unnecessary’ information on some of the screens made it difficult for the users to navigate the application </li>
    <i class="i-s"> “Seems like a bit too much information all at once when I just want to see if a fish is sustainable or not” </i> <br><br>
    <li> Asks for information the users don’t have access too
    All 6 of our users couldn’t complete the task because they didn’t know the exact species of the fish to select (most menus only list the general seafood name and don’t delve into the exact species)</li>

    <i class="i-s"> “I really like shrimp so let me see if its sustainable. The menu doesn’t say what kind of shrimp. 
Shrimp aesop, banana prawn,pink shrimp,atlantic shrimp, blue shrimp. I don’t know what kind of shrimp im eating.” </i>

        </div>
    </div>
 <li> Even though 4 of the 6 users were able to understand the sustainability rating system, they all had to look at the key (which one user completely missed). This was because the application used both the number and the color of the fish icons to show sustainability causing confusion.  </li>
 
    <i class="i-s"> “Some are sustainable and some aren’t. They’re giving me some yellow, green, red and grey looking fish. I don’t know what they mean. I’m guessing the grey ones are good. I don’t know why there are 4. I think all colors aren’t good.” </i>

    <p class="text-center"> Key insights from other apps </p>     
   <h5> Key takeaways</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>Users just quickly want to know the sustainability rating of the fish and want more details and other features to be hidden </li>
        <li> Users like filtering and sorting options </li>
        <li> Generally menu items only have the name of the seafood dish and not of the particular species used, so most of these apps are useless for the consumer</li>
        <li>Red, green and orange are good indicators of sustainability  </li>


    </ul>
<h3> Redesign </h3>

<h5> Target User </h5>
<p>After our usability testing we decided to target the consumer user base as opposed to businesses (restaurants, suppliers, fishermen). We narrowed down the target user because</p>

<ul> 
<li> The user experience is particularly bad for these users as the app expects them to have access to information which they don’t</li>

<li> Redesigning the app for both intended audiences may have spread us too thin for this project as each audience has different needs. Picking one group and focusing on how to solve their specific problems would lead to well thought out and robust solutions
</li>

<li> The requirements document provided by the Monterey Bay Aquarium lays an emphasis on redesigning the app for the user who just wants to know which fish to buy (consumer)</li>
    </ul>

            <p class="caption"> Style Guide </p>
        </div>
    </div>
      
   
</div>

<h5> Prototype </h5>

<p>After brainstorming and developing  and peer testing several prototypes we landed on an application that focuses on stores and resturants and their respective stock and menu items.

With the consumer in mind and the task of finding sustainable fish quickly as the goal, we came up with two main use cases for our redesign: </p>

<ul>
<li> User has decided the restaurant/store and needs to decide what to buy</li>

<li> User needs to decide what store/restaurant to go to</li>

</ul>
 <p> We came up with a prototype with which we conducted another round of usability tests with 4 users and we also informally recieved feedback from peers and instructors during a class presentation </p>

 <p> Most changes after this round of testing  were minor UI adjustments with the exception of removing Yelp reviews from resturants cards since users still preferred browsing Yelp for that purpose</p>
