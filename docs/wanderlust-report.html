    <span class="span-subtitle"> I worked in a team of 5 developers and designers to  design the user experience and interface, conduct usability tests and code the frontend of the React Native mobile application. I updated the original project for this portfolio</span>

 <div class="project-content container-fluid">
 	
 
 	<p> I joined the project after it had gone through an initial 10-week design cycle of design research and prototyping.
      </p>
      <h3>Recap- Design Cycle #1</h3>
      

 	<h4> Problem </h4>
    
 	<p>
 		People need a way to find interesting places, avoid unsafe areas, and be immersed in their current environment while navigating. Because traditional maps only suggest the fastest routes, people with the aforementioned desires cannot fulfill their needs
 	</p>
    <h4> Solution </h4>
    <p>Wanderlust is an alternative navigation application that provides users with high-level information about their surroundings and lets them wander in a boundary. It aims to facilitate immersion in the environment and worry-free exploration. </p>
  

 	<h4> Features </h4>
 	<ul>
 		<li> General directions to a destination without a set route</li>
 		<li> Draw boundary to restrict wandering path  </li>
 		<li> Unsafe areas and points of interests are clustered in groups </li>
 
 	</ul>
      
    <h3>Design Cycle #2</h3>
  

    <h4> Usability Study + Iteration #1</h4>
    <p>We conducted usability studies with the existing application with 3 people visiting the Stanford Campus.  </p>
    <h5> Scenario </h5 >
    <p> A user starts their journey from the Visitorâ€™s Center aiming to go to the Knight Management Center. They have 15 minutes to get there (2x the time it actually takes). We want them to check out some tourist attractions and shops while avoiding areas marked as unsafe</p>

    <p> We broke this down further into 3 tasks: </p>
    <ul>    
        <li>Complete map by setting destination and boundary</li>

        <li>Navigate to a nearby place of interest </li>

        <li>Get out of boundary or enter unsafe place - We simulated, moving out of the boundary since our participants were short on time </li>
    </ul>



    <h5> Important Insights and how to fix them </h5>
    <ul> 
        <li>We found it hard to communicate the idea of an alternative navigation application to the users when they kept expecting the application to tell them which direction to take. </li>
        <li> They were also confused by the wander boundary and didn't understand its purpose. </li>
        <br>
        <blockquote> <i>"What's the purpose of me drawing in the area?" </i></blockquote>
        <br>
        <span class="highlight">To get this idea across we decided to create an onboarding experience for the application. </span>

        <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" id="onboarding" src ="images/wanderlust/onboarding.png">

        <li>It was difficult for all 3 users to keep track of colors mapping to points of interest. </li>

        <li>The different colors made the application look very cluttered and we realized adding more points of interests would only add to that clutter. </li>

        <li>The initial design hypothesized that hiding specefics about points of interest and clustering them together would help the users be immersed in their environment. We found it had the opposite affect since all users during our test were constantly confused and annoyed by not being able to see what was around them. </li>
        </li>
        <br> 
        <span class="highlight"> To tackle all the issues we reduced color highlighting to a single red color to mark unsafe areas. We removed the clustering of points of interests and seperated each out, represented by its own icon on the map.  </span>
        <div class="text-center">
            <img class="img-fluid screenshot" src="images/wanderlust/iteration1.jpg"> 
        </div>
        <li> Users often got stuck while drawing the wander boundary. The issues werent just restricted to the mechanics of the drawing itself, but they also didnt understand the purpose of drawing one. </li>
        <br>
        <span class="highlight"> To solve this we added a floating popup that instructs the user why and how to draw the wander boundary </span>
        <div class="text-center mb-5">
            <img class="img-fluid screenshot" src="images/wanderlust/helperpopup.png"> 
        </div>

     <li>
        During navigation, points of interest could be filtered by swiping up from the bottom of the screen but not surprisingly, this interaction was completely unintuitive for our users.
    </li> 
    <br> 
    <span class="highlight">  We made the points of interest collapsible in a filter button that always remained on the screen. </span>

    <div class="text-center">  
    <img class="img-fluid screenshot my-3" src="images/wanderlust/filterIconAnim.gif">
    </div> 
    <li> 
        A lot of the confusion during our usability studies were because of dissimilarity between our application  and other ones that use maps(uber/lyft/google maps). 
    </li>
    <br> 
    <span class="highlight"> 
          So while we were porting our app to React we thought of doing an entire redesign. These included major and minor changes including changing the current location and destination markers to make them more consistent with other applications. </span>

        <img class="img-fluid screenshot" src="images/wanderlust/iteration1d.jpg">

</div>


<h5 class="mt-5"> Tasks </h5> 
</div>  
<img class="img-fluid" src="images/wanderlust/task1a.png">
<p> The user sets his destination and a time to get there by.</p>
<img class="img-fluid mt-4" src="images/wanderlust/task2a.png">
<p>The user draws a boundary to restrict his wandering path, potentially avoiding unsafe areas and wandering off too far.The application notifies him if he does so. </p>
<img class="img-fluid mt-4" src="images/wanderlust/task3a.png">
<p class="mb-4">The user can explore the area in the distraction free mode which only shows him points of interests, unsafe areas and the general direction to his/her destination. The user can view more information about points of interest, see what other people have said and then give his/her own feedback.  </p>


<h4> Usability Study + Iteration #2</h4>

<p>After making the affformentioned changes we conducted another study, similar to the previous one. </p> 

 <h5> Important Insights and how to fix them </h5>
    <ul> 
        <li>We found that adding instructions to draw the boundary was still not very useful. We often recieved comments such as  <i>"I don't know what boundary to draw" </i>  </span>
        We realized that people, especially ones new to an area werent aware of what was around them which is why they couldnt really draw a boundary
        </li>
        <br>

        <span class="highlight"> We still wanted to restrict the users movement so they didnt wander too far from their destination, so we came up with a walkmap to constantly give them a view of how far things were from them </span>
        <div class="text-center my-3">
            <img class="img-fluid screenshot" src ="images/wanderlust/walkmap.png">
        </div>

        <li> Users in our new study almost always found the little compass at the bottom, hard to find. </li>
        <br>
        <span class="highlight"> We removed the compass and changed it to a bouncing arrow to guide the user </span>
        <div class="text-center mt-4">
